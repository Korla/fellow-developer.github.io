I'm PÃ¤r Dahlman, the founder, CTO and waterboy at _Fellow Developer_. First and foremost, I'm a social guy and experienced developer with _passion for what I do_. I've designed, developed and maintained everything from monolithic legacy systems to distributed, event driven micro services.

I'm a technical consultat, system architect, scrum master and team member that can be a great addition to software teams in all different phases of development. Simply put: a fellow developer at your service.
